# Flip A Coin
This is a simple coin flip simulation using WebGL and basic game design techniques.

The aim of this project is for me to learn the basics of WebGL and to implement a basic game engine from scratch.

## Controls

- Left click anywhere on the window to flip the coin
- Use arrow keys and mouse wheel/trackpad to move the camera
